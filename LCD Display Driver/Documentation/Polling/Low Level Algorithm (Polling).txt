Low Level Algorithm

Initialization:	
	Turn on I2C clock
		Write 0x02 to 0x44E00048
	Change pin modes for I2C1, set slew rate, disable pullup/down
		Write 0x6A to 0x44E1095C and 0x44E10958
	Put I2C1 into reset
		Write 0x02 to 0x4802A010
	Divide 48MHz clock by 4 to get 12MHz
		Write 0x03 to 0x4802A0B0
	Set data rate to 100KB/s
		Write 0x35 to 0x4802A0B4
		Write 0x37 to 0x4802A0B8
	Configure I2C1 address
		Write 0x00 to 0x4802A0A8
	Take I2C1 out of reset, enable transmission and master modes
		Write 0x8600 to 0x4802A0A4
	Set number of command bytes (0x0A) to be sent
		Write 0x0A to 0x4802A098
	Configure I2C1 slave address
		Write 0x3C to 0x4802A0AC
	Clear interrupts that will be checked later (XRDY,BB,ARDY)
		Write 0x1014 to 0x4802A028

Sending the commands:
	Branch link to BB_POLL
	Branch link to RESTART
	Reset register for indexing command array
		Write 0x00 to R2 (Being reserved as the index register)
	Branch to SEND_INSTRUCTIONS
	
SEND_INSTRUCTIONS:
	@Throw in a Branch Link to WAIT before basically anything happens
	Branch Link to XRDY_POLL
	Load pointer to instructions data
		Load from =INSTRUCTIONS
		Load one byte using index register as offset
			Load from =INSTRUCTIONS with R2 as offset
		Increment index register
			Add 1 to R2
	Store the byte into the I2C1_DATA register to be transferred
		StoreByte to 0x4802A09C
	Branch Link to XRDY_CLEAR
	Test ARDY to see if there are more bytes to be sent
		TST ARDY bit (0x04) in I2C_IRQSTATUS_RAW (0x4802A024)
		If there is, BEQ back to SEND_INSTRUCTION
	@Prep for sending data
	Take I2C out of reset
		Write 0x8600 to 0x4802A0A4
	Set number of data bytes to be sent (0x0F)
		Write 0x0F to 0x4802A098
	Branch Link to BB_POLL
	Branch Link to RESTARt
	Reset index register for sending the data
		Write 0x00 to R2
	Head to SEND_MESSAGE
	
SEND_MESSAGE:
	@Throw in a Branch Link to WAIT before basically anything happens
	Branch Link to XRDY_POLL
	Load pointer to message data
		Load from =MESSAGE
		Load one byte using index register as offset
			Load from =MESSAGE with R2 as offset
		Increment index register
			Add 1 to R2
	Branch Link to XRDY_CLEAR
	Test ARDY to see if there are more bytes to be sent
		Mask ARDY bit (0x04) in I2C_IRQSTATUS_RAW (0x4802A024)
		AND and then TST with 0x04
		If there is, BEQ back to SEND_INSTRUCTION
	Branch Link to QUIT (same as restart, probably not needed)
	Branch to ENDLESS_LOOP because theres nothing else to be done
	
BB_POLL:
	Keep looping until the BB bit goes high in IRQSTATUS_RAW, then pop back
		TST 0x1000 at 0x4802A024
		BNE to BB_POLL
		MOV PC,R14
XRDY_POLL:
	Keep looping until the XRDY bit goes high in IRQSTATUS_RAW, then pop back
		TST 0x10 at 0x4802A024
		BNE to BB_POLL
		MOV PC,R14
XRDY_CLEAR:	
	Just write a 1 to the XRDY bit in IRQSTATUS_RAW to clear it, pop back
		Write 0x10 to 0x4802A028
		MOV PC,R14
RESTART:
	Query a start and stop condition
		Write 0x8603 0x4802A0A4
ENDLESS_LOOP:	
	Just keeps branching to ENDLESS_LOOP
	
WAIT:
	Loads a value of 0x2000 (just randomly chosen value)
	Heads to WAITLOOP where it will decrement and keep looping until zero
		After it's zero it will pop off and return
