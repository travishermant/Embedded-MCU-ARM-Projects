High Level Algorithm

Initialization:	
	Turn on I2C clock
	Change pin modes for I2C1, set slew rate, disable pullup/down
	Put I2C1 into reset
	Divide 48MHz clock by 4 to get 12MHz
	Set data rate to 100KB/s
	Configure I2C1 address
	Take I2C1 out of reset, enable transmission and master modes
	Set number of command bytes (0x0A) to be sent
	Configure I2C1 slave address
	Clear interrupts that will be checked later (XRDY,BB,ARDY)

Sending the commands:
	Branch link to BB_POLL
	Branch link to RESTART
	Reset register for indexing command array
	Branch to SEND_INSTRUCTIONS
	
SEND_INSTRUCTIONS:
	@Throw in a Branch Link to WAIT before basically anything happens
	Branch Link to XRDY_POLL
	Load pointer to instructions data
		Load one byte using index register as offset
		Increment index register
	Store the byte into the I2C1_DATA register to be transferred
	Branch Link to XRDY_CLEAR
	Test ARDY to see if there are more bytes to be sent
		If there is, branch back to beginning
	@Prep for sending data
	Set number of data bytes to be sent (0x0F)
	Branch Link to BB_POLL
	Branch Link to RESTARt
	Reset index register for sending the data
	Head to SEND_MESSAGE
	
SEND_MESSAGE:
	@Throw in a Branch Link to WAIT before basically anything happens
	Branch Link to XRDY_POLL
	Load pointer to message data
		Load one byte using index register as offset
		Increment index register
	Branch Link to XRDY_CLEAR
	Test ARDY to see if there are more bytes to be sent
		If there is, branch back to beginning
	Branch Link to QUIT (same as restart, probably not needed)
	Branch to ENDLESS_LOOP because theres nothing else to be done
BB_POLL:
	Keep looping until the BB bit goes high in IRQSTATUS_RAW, then pop back

XRDY_POLL:
	Keep looping until the XRDY bit goes high in IRQSTATUS_RAW, then pop back

XRDY_CLEAR:	
	Just write a 1 to the XRDY bit in IRQSTATUS_RAW to clear it, pop back

RESTART:
	Query a start and stop condition

ENDLESS_LOOP:	
	Just keeps branching to ENDLESS_LOOP
	
WAIT:
	Loads a value of 0x2000 (just randomly chosen value)
	Heads to WAITLOOP where it will decrement and keep looping until zero
		After it's zero it will pop off and return
